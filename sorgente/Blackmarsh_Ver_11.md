#  Blackmarsh

## Introduction

At the dawn of roleplaying, the campaign and its setting were already
established. One could say it preceded the RPG itself, as Dave Arneson
adapted the ideas of Major David Wesely’s Braustein game for his
Blackmoor campaign. Slightly later, Gary Gygax created Greyhawk. From
the experience gained with these campaigns, the first roleplaying game
was written. In all the years since, the campaign has been the
centerpiece. Yet few roleplaying games included a fully useable campaign
setting with their rules.

The limits of roleplaying games are only bound by the collective
imagination of the referee and his players. But first time referees are
often daunted not only by the effort needed to master the game rules,
but also having to create a campaign setting. Many have given the advice
to start out small, to detail a town or village near a dungeon as the
initial focus of the campaign. As the referee gains experience, he can
later expand into the surrounding wilderness, fleshing out the campaign
setting with as much detail as he wishes.

As good as that advice is, it would help to have examples of what a
fleshed out campaign would look like. Blackmarsh is not meant to define
the limits of older editions, but rather their possibilities, to show
referees a way of organizing their own campaigns and finally as a source
of inspiration.

Blackmarsh was designed to evoke the earliest campaigns of the world’s
most popular roleplaying game. It takes place amid a wilderness full of
danger and the possibility of great treasure. It is organized as a
numbered hex grid with locales keyed to specific hexes. Locales are
described briefly in a paragraph or two. Most locales are meant to serve
as a springboard for the referee to create his own details. In addition,
geographical entities, organizations, and realms that span multiple
hexes are described as well.

### The Hex Map

A grid of hexes, arranged in columns, make up the map. The hex numbers
are given in a four-digit format (1213, 0114, etc). For example, 0211
means that it is in the "02" column (the 2<sup>nd</sup> column of the
map) and is 11 hexes down. Sometimes the hex number will not be clear
because of the terrain in the hex. In this case, you will need to count
the hexes. Each map hex is 5 miles.

This system of using hex numbers allows a referee to quickly find the
locales on the map and what is near a location. This helps keep the map
uncluttered and easy to read. Geographical features are composed of
multiple hexes and are labeled directly on the map. They are listed
alphabetically in that map’s chapter.

### Adventuring Advice

This format is designed to make it easy to referee players as they
explore the world. With a list of locales, it is easy for the referee to
determine what is over the next hill and what possible challenges the
players might face. In addition, since the players can largely be left
to their own devices, this format allows the referee more time to focus
on the core adventures in his campaign.

Not every hex location has a description, and the background information
is only meant to be a loose framework. Referees are encouraged to add
material and make the setting unique to their campaigns.

It is suggested that to get maximum use of this setting that the referee
look over the locales, then chose the ones that best suit the campaign.
Note the NPCs and their circumstances. Develop a timeline of events if
the characters are not involved. Detail important locales and add new
ones of your own design. Do the same for the NPCs, and make notes on
their motivations and personalities.

After each session of the campaign, review what the players did. Look at
your original timeline of events, see what impact their actions had, and
make the needed changes. Sometimes the players’ actions will lead to a
new and unexpected chain of events.

The creativity of the referee comes by not forcing his players to follow
a predetermined story, but to develop new and interesting consequences
based on the players’ actions. Use the NPC’s motivations and
personalities to decide which consequences are the most likely and pick
the most interesting.

The result is a campaign where the players feel they are forging their
character’s destiny within a living, breathing world. It will not only
be fun and adventurous, but also filled with surprises. Consequences
will accumulate and spin the campaign into unexpected directions.

## Overview

Blackmarsh lies on the fringe of civilization, located around a large
bay on the western edge of the Grey Sea. For a brief time, the frontiers
of the great empires encompassed the region, but they retreated
centuries ago. Only a few outposts of civilization remain amid the
dangers of the encroaching wilderness.

The bay that dominates Blackmarsh was created two millennia ago by the
disaster known as The Mountain That Fell. After The Mountain That Fell,
strange and terrible monsters appeared in the surrounding wasteland. The
elves arrived in Blackmarsh, drove the fell creatures into hiding, and
healed the land. However, after two and a half millennia, their power is
waning and the monsters have crept back into the dark corners of the
wilderness.

A thousand years ago, the Bright Empire settled Castle Blackmarsh and
for a brief time the races were united in an alliance and pushed back
the monsters. Then eight hundred years ago, the Bright Empire collapsed
after being defeated by the barbarians in the cataclysmic battle known
as The Shattering. Blackmarsh was one of the first regions to be
abandoned. Left in the wake of the empire’s retreat was a patchwork of
realms ruled by petty kings and tyrants.

Since the Shattering, the frontier has slowly retreated. In place of the
ordered safety of the Bright Empire, monsters, barbarians, and other
increasingly roamed without restraint. In the present day, those who
come to Blackmarsh are more interested in viz, killing monsters, or the
strange artifacts left by The Mountain That Fell than establishing new
settlements. The only force that stands against the wilderness is the
Blackmarsh Rangers. Anyone who is willing to defend the land and its
people are welcomed into their ranks.

### The Mountain That Fell

In the days when man knew only the working of stone and fought for their
existence against the orc and the goblin, the sky turned to ash and down
fell the fiery mountain onto the land. The world tore open and the grey
waters rushed in. Those who survived the impact were lost as boiling
clouds rushed out in all directions leaving a wasteland in its wake.

The Mountain That Fell left a gift; magic. Near and far, those of
learning and strong of heart discovered new powers to shape the world.
In the desolation around the Smoking Bay the adventurous found viz,
magic in physical form. And there was more, scattered amid the landscape
were strange artifacts and stranger creatures that survived The Mountain
That Fell. For a time men, dwarves, orc, goblins, and other races braved
the dangers and fought each other in the wastelands. Then the elves came
into Blackmarsh expelled the feuding races, drove the monsters out, and
healed the land.

### Viz

Viz is a magical substance that takes many forms. It could be a flask of
pure spring water, a newly bloomed flower, or an iridescent rock. What
all these items have in common is they are infused with pure magic. Viz
can be used in the casting of spells or the creation of magic items.

Viz allows a magic user to cast spells without losing it from memory.
The viz is consumed in the process. One viz for a first level spell, two
viz for a second level spell, three for a 3rd level spell and so on. One
viz is worth 100 GP towards the creation of a magic item. The referee
can use viz as treasure usable towards the creation of a magic item in
place of giving out more gold pieces.

### The Wild North

To the north of Blackmarsh lies the Wild North, a cold land of dark fir
and taiga. The mighty Belaya River runs through the heart of the land.
Scattered through the Wild North are the human Rurasin city-states.

### Southland

Bordering Blackmarsh to the south is the region known as Southland. It
lies on the frontier of the Vasa Province of the Grand Kingdom and was
recently opened for settlement. The Kingdom of Bolzak in the White
Mountains is the birthplace of many dwarves in Blackmarsh.

### Adaption Notes

The map for Blackmarsh is designed to work with the Lands of Adventure,
a series of settings. For those with the Lands of Adventure product (or
the earlier Points of Light products from Goodman Games) Blackmarsh
adjoins along the northern edge of Southland and lies a hundred miles to
the west of Wildlands. It is set during the time period depicted in
Southland, the era of the Grand Kingdom.

There are several possibilities to place Blackmarsh in your existing
campaign. The first, it’s located on the frontier of the “known world”.
A once wide spread empire, that encompassed Blackmarsh, has since
retreated or collapsed. Another possibility, Blackmarsh is located in an
out of the way corner of the world where the land is marginal for
farming and mining. In times of decline, it is one of the first places
to be abandoned, or at best ignored.

The settlements of the four races (man, elves, dwarves, halflings) are
distant colonies of racial homelands. The remoteness of Blackmarsh means
that these settlements are effectively independent.

There are four distinct areas of men in Blackmarsh. The Ostrobards are
new to civilization, having shed their barbarian ways in the last
century. There are the men along the southern shore of the Smoking Bay
running from Castle Blackmarsh in the west to Jorvik in the east. They
are a surviving remnant of the Bright Empire. The Vasan Vikings have
four settlements along the eastern edge of Blackmarsh. They arrived here
after they lost much of their homeland to the Grand Kingdom. Finally,
there is the Grand Kingdom which is starting to expand into Blackmarsh.

Several references are made to the dwarven kingdom of Bolzak which is
found in Southland. This can be ignored or replaced with a suitable
dwarven kingdom of your choosing. Olden Hold is a base for the dwarves
to explore Blackmarsh so it is not critical to have a kingdom
immediately to the south.

The Blackmarsh Rangers are designed as an organization indigenous to the
area. If a referee wants to incorporate the Ranger class this would be a
natural starting point.

For the House of the Raven, a referee could use the dark elves from
other fantasy roleplaying games. As presented in Blackmarsh, they are a
group who believe that the elves should rule and enslave other races.
This is considered abhorrent to the cultures of Blackmarsh.

## Geography

The aftermath of The Mountain That Fell has had a major impact on the
region’s geography. The impact caused many cracks and shifts in the
land, forming the numerous swamps and estuaries of the region. Even
after two thousand years, and the best efforts of the elves, much of the
shoreline is a confusing maze of waterways.

### Alhert Island

This long barrier island has little of note other than scrub and sand.
The unique Pyrocantha bush grows in abundance here. Its berries can be
harvested in the fall and used to create a salve that when rubbed on
armor gives a +1 bonus. Unfortunately, the salve lasts only a single
battle, but additional doses can be applied. Multiple applications of
the salve do not have an accumulative effect.

### Dragonbone Peaks

The western slopes of these high mountains took the brunt of the debris
ejected from the crash of The Mountain That Fell. The debris covers most
of the valleys of western slopes. In the centuries since, an extensive
cavern system has formed. It is believed the network extends for miles
along the western edge of the mountain range.

### Driftwood Isle

The currents of the Grey Sea caused this island to accumulate a large
amount of driftwood as well as other objects from the wind and tide.
Along the southeast peninsula, the scattered remains of a ship can be
found. Beneath a pile of seaweed is a body of a young man dressed in the
style of a high noble of the Grand Kingdom. His hand clutches a necklace
with the royal seal.

### Lanis River

The Lanis River flows north from Southland and is three miles wide when
it enters Blackmarsh. The current is deep and slow and easily allows
ships and barges to travel in both directions. Merchants travel between
Castle Blackmarsh, Westguard and the dwarven kingdom of Bolzak.
Sometimes the occasional Vasan longship will try their luck raiding
farther south.

### Pendar Mountains

A spur of the White Mountains they connect a hundred miles to the
northwest. They are known for the numerous goblin tribes that inhabit
the little explored mountain valleys.

### Rednut River

This river gets its name from the number of Rednut groves growing along
its banks. The Rednut is considered a tasty delicacy by the inhabitants
and animals of Blackmarsh. Every fall, the river surface is covered with
floating rednuts as they drop from the trees. This has the unfortunate
effect of attracting hippogriffs and griffons who swoop down and scoop
them off the water. They are not above trying to take a more meaty bite
from an unwary traveler on the river.

### Sandstone Island

The leeward side (facing Sheltered Bay) is a mass of sandstone that was
heavily cracked from the crash of The Mountain That Fell. There are
numerous ravines, gullies, and chasms throughout the length of the
island. This is a favorite haunt for vikings and pirates to hide their
treasure. Windward, it gradually fills in with sand until the beach dunes are reached.

### Sheltered Bay

A chain of islands absorbs the brunt of any storm sweeping in from the
Grey Sea. It is also the only entrance into the Smoking Bay and the rest
of Blackmarsh. There is a 1 in 3 chance per day of encountering a ship
entering or leaving the Smoking Bay.

### Smoking Bay

The Mountain That Fell created the Smoking Bay and for a century
afterwards, pillars of steam rose from the waters and were seen for
hundreds of miles away. The pillars of steam have since subsided, but
the name remains. The sea bottom is a confusing maze of rubble with many
areas unexplored. Many sea creatures have moved in to take advantage of
the chaotic terrain to hide.

### The Black Marshes

The impact of The Mountain That Fell fractured this region forming the
marshes that give the area its name. The marshes are fifteen miles
north-south and over fifty miles east-west. The impact left several
large lakes connected by a confusing maze of waterways and bogs. It
offers a convenient place to hide for those who want keep their
activities away from prying eyes. The water is black in color caused by
the minerals leeching from the surrounding soil and vegetation.

### The Crimson Hills

Over the centuries, numerous orc tribes conquered and were conquered
among these hills. Their continual conflict has caused this region to be
known as the Crimson Hills. The two main tribes are the Bateaters (1911)
and the Bloodcrushers (2207), but there are several smaller orc clans
and families hiding and hunting in the hills.

### The Grey Sea

The Grey Sea is known for its storms, strong currents, treacherous
reefs, and superb fishing grounds. After the collapse of the Bright
Empire reavers, vikings and pirates dominated the waters, but the rise
of the Grand Kingdom has largely brought peace to the Grey Sea. Only the
Vasan Vikings and a few pirate ships remain to challenge the might of
the Grand Kingdom’s navy.

### The Greywoods

Over a thousand elves make their home in this forest. The forest gets
its name from the Grey Ash trees, whose seeds in the fall, dry into a
grey ash like color. The seeds littering the forest floor remind the
elves of the wasteland that once existed here in the aftermath of The
Mountain That Fell. The ash seeds are also a potent source of viz,
jealously guarded by the elves for their own use.

### The Tave Marshes

Unlike the Black Marshes there are not many lakes in the Tave Marshes.
Instead, there is a network of estuaries connected by small steams and
bogs. The region is largely avoided by the surrounding races due to the
evil reputation of the weretigers that dwell within the swamp.

### The White Mountains

These majestic, snowcapped mountains stretch far to the northwest, and
are the highest known in the regions. The dwarven kingdom of Bolzak lies
to the south and Olden Hold is the northernmost outpost.

The White Mountains teem with game, and great predators, such as
griffons and hippogriffs, making their home in the high aeries. Stone
giants are known to roam to the edge of the mountains, and although they
don’t often attack, they will attack small parties of travelers.

### Thornbrush Island

The leeward side of this island is choked with groves of thorny bushes
and hedges. Numerous game trails form an extensive maze that wild boars
(2 HD) and other creatures use.

### The Westwall

Farther south, the Westwall forms the western boundary of the Vasa
Province of the Grand Kingdom. The northern terminus ends in Blackmarsh
and is home to several clans of hill giants.

##  Locales

**0105** These are the ruins of Daur Anthar, the hold of the famed
Dwarven Ironmaster, Gamli Norreshield. It is here that he found a vein
of metal rich in viz and researched its use in the forging of arms and
armor. When the hold was abandoned several hundred years ago, an earth
elemental (HD 12) remained to guard the ruins.

**0107** A band of brigands are bent on vengeance against the Rangers of
Blackmarsh and are marching on Blackoak Castle. Sigrun the Boneless
(Ftr9), two captains (Ftr6,5), and three lieutenants (Ftr4) lead 115
brigands.

**0211** Viewing the Halflings of Newcombe as easy prey, King Graptar
the Stupendous (treat as a hobgoblin and wielding a +1 warhammer) moved
150 goblins into the Pendar Mountains where they established their new
base. Surrounding the king are twelve guards (treat as hobgoblins) who
protect Graptar against any usurpers.

**0214** A mother black dragon (old, HD 8) and her child (young, HD 7)
have slaughtered a herd of deer and are in a meadow consuming the
carcasses.

**0217 Oldan Hold**, Pop: 342, Dwarf; Align L; Ruler: Lord Mazardan,
Ftr6, L, Dwarf; Resource: Market.

Oldan Hold is the northernmost outpost of the Dwarven Kingdom of Bolzak.
It was founded as a base for the search of viz by the Ironmasters of
Bolzak. It’s become an entrepôt where merchants all over Blackmarsh come
and trade with the dwarves. There are 5d10 foreign merchants (human,
elf, halflings) with their guards present.

Lord Mazardan was one of the most successful explorers and appointed as
Lord of Oldan Hold two decades ago. He is also High Captain of the
Northern Company of Adventurers. An association of explorers looking for
sources of viz. Every year he hosts a grand banquet in the company hall
where members and their friends eat and tell tales of their discoveries.

**0302** The inside of this bend on the Rednut River is riddled with
giant snake dens. Every 100 yards there is a 3 in 6 chance of
encountering either a hole to a den (1-4) or a giant snake (HD 2)(5-6).

**0309** This crumbling wizard’s keep dates back a thousand years to the
time of the Bright Empire. An experiment gone awry left the keep
infested with numerous ochre jellies (HD 5), including one very large
black pudding (HD 10, 60 hp) in the old great hall.

**0318** A herd of mean tempered wild boars (HD 3) roam the slopes of
the White Mountains here. Even hunters from Olden Hold (see 0217) avoid
this valley. There is a 1 in 4 chance of encountering 4d4 boars per hour
while in the region.

**0407** **Blackoak Castle**; Sinerian, Ftr4/Mu6 L, Elf; 50 elves, 60
men, 40 dwarves, 20 halflings.

This castle is the headquarters of the Blackmarsh Rangers, an
organization dedicated to preserving peace between the races and keeping
Blackmarsh free from the depredations of monsters. They consider the
Brotherhood of the Raven their mortal enemy (see 1807). The Temple of
Thor at Castle Blackmarsh is an ally especially when monsters are
involved.

The Blackmarsh Rangers were founded by the legendary Geran Blackoak
fifteen centuries ago during the invasion of the Ostrobard barbarians.
Geran Blackoak was instrumental in restoring the peace. While he failed
to unite them politically, a tradition of mutual assistance took hold
among the races.

The castle serves as the primary training ground for new rangers
recruits as well as a meeting place for the biannual gathering of the
captains. It contains workshops and stores to supply the various ranger
circles wandering throughout Blackmarsh. Clerics of Silvanus, the Forest
Lord, are traditionally stationed at the castle to provide aid and
support. Thanks to the elves, one of the finest schools of magic in the
Blackmarsh region is found here. The school tends to study the practical
rather than theoretical aspects of magic.

High Captain Sinerian has been the leader for over a century and expects
to serve for several decades more. Her greatest challenges have been
dealing with the raids of the Vasan Vikings from across the Grey Sea,
and the rising power of the Grand Kingdom to the southeast. If the
Rurasin city-states to the north unite, it may prove another threat to
the peace.

**0409 Strangeholms**, Pop: 292, Halfling; Align L; Ruler: Mayor Holbein
Redleaf, 0-lvl, L; Resource: Farm.

Strangeholms is a halfling village that surrounds a large hill south of
the Holms Water. The region around the village has rich soil for farming
and the halflings supply much of the food needed by Castle Blackoak (see
0407).

Mayor Holbein, along with his constable, keeps the peace, but struggles
when the occasional monster emerges from the ruined wizard keep (see
0309) to the northwest. In addition to being mayor, Holbein is a skilled
painter and has had his work commissioned several times by the wealthy
and nobles of Blackmarsh.

**0413** A tribe of 190 kobolds dominate the forest north of the lake.
High Chief Cruk rules the kobolds with the assistance of six other
chiefs of the tribe (treat as goblins). He also leads the kobolds in the
worship of a strange glowing sword of law in an open grove at the center
of the forest. When the kobolds first arrived, a century ago, they tried
to take the sword, but it killed any who touched it.

**0415** These islands are known as the three sisters. Each island is
the home of a nixie (HD 1, charm) and the three of them are rival
sisters. They use their Charm Person ability to compete among themselves
for the most handsome captives. They are not above conspiring with
outsiders if it means that one sister is denied her prize.

**0515** This is the dwelling place of the Lake King (HD 5, charm) and
his court of 80 nixies (HD 1, charm). He will release anybody captured
if they will kidnap his quarreling daughters and bring them home to him.
(see 0515)

**0605** A weak wall exists between this world and other planes of
existence in the elven forest. Here the fabric of reality has been torn,
48 elves are fighting a 12 flame demons (treat as 8 HD Fire Elementals).
Several dozen more elves surround the conflict trying to contain the
blaze started by the fight.

**0608** **Ashdown**, Pop: 121, Mixed; Align L; Ruler: Councilor Neera
Dane, Ftr6, L; Resource: Market.

Ashdown is home to many retired rangers as well as the spouses and
children of rangers currently on duty. Neera Dane, a retired ranger
captain leads the village council and operates under the authority of
the high captain of the rangers. She and the villagers will gladly aid
any friend and ally of the rangers. Halflings, men, dwarves, and elves
can be found living here.

**0610** **Greenton**, Pop: 642, Halfling; Align L; Ruler: Ealdorman
Paddock Ryburn, L; Resource: Farm.

Greenton is the chief settlement of the Newcombe Halflings and an
important market for the surrounding farms. Here merchants from across
Blackmarsh flock to purchase grain and other produce to export back to
their home regions. When in residence, the merchants stay in a hamlet
just outside of Greenton known as Sack. So named from the stuffed
woolsacks the merchants sit on while bidding or negotiating prices.
Ealdorman Paddock maintains a large contingent of 20 constables led by
Sherriff Barris Ironoak to keep the merchants in their place.

**0616** Ruchill Burn runs through a 50’ deep gorge for over a half
mile. During the Bright Empire, magic-users established a conclave here
to harvest the viz found within the cliffs of the gorge. Two centuries
after the empire’s fall, the conclave was abandoned. The cliffs are
honeycombed with several levels of the conclave. Many of the levels span
both sides of the gorge with bridges connecting them. Not all of them
are safe.

**0702** Six trolls (HD 6, Regen) feast on corpses from a slain merchant
caravan from Muncaester (see 1305). The smoke from their cooking fire
can be seen from two miles away.

**0712** This ruined tower was once used as a lighthouse. It guided
ships to the mouth of the Lanis River. Built during the Bright Empire it
was abandoned several centuries ago. Since then, a succession of leaders
of chaos expanded the complex beneath the tower to create a base to be
used against Castle Blackmarsh (see 0913). Currently, it’s believed to
be empty having been cleared by adventurers over forty years ago after
the killing of Atacyl Oathbinder, an undead vampire magic-user.

**0804** **Stardell Falls**, Pop: 503, Elf; Align L; Ruler: King Nilal,
Ftr4/Mu8, L; Resource: Magic.

Stardell Falls is the heart of the Greywoods. The village consists of
individual steadings arrayed in a series of semi-circles around a
40-foot waterfall. On either side of the falls are two towers made of a
shimmering grey stone, and a bridge connects the two. The west tower is
the King’s Tower and the east tower is the Queen’s tower. Here King
Nilal resides with his queen, the Lady Aerindel (Ftr4/Mu8).

The waterfall is a rich source of viz. Elven magic-users inhabit the
steadings surrounding the lynn. At the base, behind the falls, is a
magnificent temple to Silvanus the Forest Lord. The temple is carved out
of the rock. The falls provide a spectacular backdrop to the services
especially when the moon or sun is at its zenith.

**0814** Scattered throughout the bogs are several small buildings that
were once the homes of magic-users researching the plants and herbs of
the region. Stone was sunk into the bogs and dry pathways were built to
connect the scattered residences. It was abandoned in the century after
the fall of the Bright Empire and time has taken its toll. Sections of
the pathways have worn away and various creatures have moved into the
abandoned dwellings. Some have reported that the wizards left unfinished
experiments and strange forms of plant life live in the ruins.

**0909** A large water elemental (16 HD) inhabits this area of the
Smoking Bay. It preys on unwary ships sucking them down into a giant
maelstrom. At the sea bottom there is a half-mile wide shallow basin
littered with the remains of the ships and treasures that the water
elemental dragged down.

**0912** This island is home to 100 men who fish the surrounding island.
They were granted this island by the lords of Castle Blackmarsh in
exchange for standing watch against any raiders, particularly Vasan
Vikings. At the south end of the island is a 20’ wooden tower that can
be seen from the main land. At the sign of danger a fire will be lit and
relayed along a series of signal towers to Castle Blackmarsh.

**0913** **Castle Blackmarsh**, Pop: 1,294, Men; Align N; Ruler:
Governor Tyrilas, Elf, Ftr4/Mu2, L; Resource: Market.

Castle Blackmarsh is the largest settlement in the Blackmarsh region. It
was originally founded by the Bright Empire over a thousand years ago
and served as the main port for various settlements and conclaves of
magic-users. It was ruled by a governor appointed by the emperor and
advised by a council of magic-users and merchants.

It survived the fall of the Bright Empire and became an independent
city-state dominating the settlements along the southern shore of the
Smoking Bay. The economic decline caused most of the outlying
settlements to be abandoned a century after the empire’s collapse. The
mages established themselves in Castle Blackmarsh, forming a conclave in
the castle.

They dominated the city-state for several centuries occasionally allying
with the other races to defeat common threats. In that time the
population of the town stabilized and found a small amount of prosperity
as adventurers entered Blackmarsh searching for viz.

A century ago, an ambitious magic-user named Atacyl Oathbinder
maneuvered his way into control of the council. He seized absolute
control of Castle Blackmarsh and ruled as a tyrant for several decades.
It is rumored that he accomplished this through a strange helmet capable
of mind control. His attempt at empire building was thwarted. The
rangers retook Castle Blackmarsh with a combined force of different
races and Blackmarsh exiles.

The elves took control of the settlement and appointed a governor at the
head of the reformed council. Castle Blackmarsh, the home of the
wizard’s conclave, was the site of many Atacyl’s experiments and magical
researches. Even after a century of rule, not all of the levels that
Atacyl created have been explored.

Forty years ago, Atacyl reappeared as a vampire magic-user and attempted
to retake Castle Blackmarsh. He was destroyed, supposedly, by a band of
adventurers and his base at the old Lanis Lighthouse (see 0712) was
purged.

## Castle Blackmarsh Establishments

### 1) Blackmarsh Castle

The castle is currently under occupation by the Greywood Elves. They
maintain sole control to prevent former allies of Atacyl Oathbinder from
gaining access to the lower levels. They do not have the manpower to
clear the dungeons. They will allow adventuring parties who have the
recommendation of the Blackmarsh Rangers or the Temple of Thor to enter.
The elves have an arrangement with the Temple of Thor to provide healing
at good rates for those that require it.

### 2) Temple of Thoth

This once glorious temple to the God of Knowledge has fallen into decay. The near destruction of the society of magic-users and scholars by Actacyl has left little for donations to maintain the grounds and buildings. Much of their income comes from charging for access to their extensive library of magic, legend, and lore.

### 3) Temple of Thor

This temple was established soon after the fall of Actacyl. With their allies, the Blackmarsh Rangers, they rid the town of the many magical traps, devices, and creatures left behind. Since then they have been the most popular temple with the hall packed on holy days. They actively seek out newcomers and encourage them to form adventuring parties. They will either send them to the elves to explore Castle Blackmarsh or into the surrounding countryside to respond to the many requests for aid.

### 4) Merry Legs Banquet Hall

This is the largest banquet hall in Castle Blackmarsh. Unlike the Viz Club it is not exclusive and any adventuring party that is willing to pay its fees may make use of the main hall and the many private dining rooms. It also makes suites of 3 to 4 rooms available to rent for parties needing a place to stay. During the evening hours, merchants, caravan masters, and ship captains dine and drink in the main hall seeking business opportunities. Starting an hour after sunset the floor show starts, it features singing bards, dancing wenches, and juggling dwarves.

### 5) The Scholar’s Inn

This is the largest inn in town. It has an extensive library that is
open to patrons. It doesn’t have the depth of the library at the Temple
of Thoth, but it has more current material. Nearly half of the rooms are
rented to what remains of the Blackmarsh Guild of Wizards. Survivors of
Actayl’s reign and the elven takeover have congregated here to restart
the guild. However, the town’s mistrust has hindered their recovery.

### 6) The Viz Club

This is a banquet hall open to members only. Only elite explorers and
adventurers are invited and the yearly fees are said to be ruinous.
However, membership gives access to information and lore found nowhere
else. The few that are invited gladly pay.

### 7) Dax Brothers Outfitters

Founded by two brothers five decades ago, this is the premier shop to
buy equipment in the Blackmarsh region. They import the best from the
Grand Kingdom and beyond. Their prices are 20% higher than normal, but
the equipment’s quality gives a +1 or +5% bonus to dice rolls involving
their use. The Dax Brothers long passed away long ago and currently a
large group of cousins are involved in running the store. Many of them
are overseas or scattered throughout the Blackmarsh region looking for
the latest goods to bring back to the shop.

### 8) Emporium of the Strange and Arcane

Not all magic-users in Blackmarsh struggled after the fall of Actacyl
and the takeover by the Elves. Thil the Cowled proved himself an ally of
the elves and the Blackmarsh Rangers and became one of the first
adventurers to become rich from exploring the dungeons beneath the
castle. After retiring from adventuring, he established the emporium to
buy and trade magic items. Now 102 years old, he leaves the day-to-day
operation to his apprentices, but will still participate in negotiations
for high value items.

Adventurers will find that there is an 80% chance that magic items worth
1,000 GP or lower can be found in stock. For items up to 5,000 GP value
there is a 20% chance of being in stock. For more valuable items, these
are auctioned off every quarter at the Viz Club. For non-members there
is a 1,000 GP entrance fee.

### 9) The Abrams Company

John Abrams is the most successful ship magnate in the Blackmarsh region
and one of the leading trading companies on the Grey Sea. He owns over
two dozen ships of various sizes, ranging from one-mast coasters to
caravels capable of crossing the vast distances to the Golden Shore
beyond the Sunrise Sea. With a recommendation, he will let an
adventuring party charter one of his ships.

### 10) The Blackmarsh Company of Adventurers

The Company of Adventurers is largest company of caravanmasters in the
Blackmarsh region. They organize overland caravans to Greywood, the
Duchy of the Ostrobards, Newcombe Shire, and into Southland. Matthew
Thanes is the latest Captain General to lead the company and is always
on the lookout for new members to join as merchants, scouts, or guards.

### 11) The Company of Honorable Men

Actacyl’s reign dispossessed many wealthy and noble inhabitants of
Blackmarsh. Driven into hiding, they attempted to strike back at the
Oathbinder’s tyranny. In subsequent decades their descendents became
little better than a group of organized thugs. Today, they gladly aid
those who are discontented with the rule of the elves while running
their illicit operation for financial gain.

{Insert Map of Castle Blackmarsh}

**0918** On a bluff, overlooking the lake, is the remains of a wizards’
conclave founded a thousand years ago during the Bright Empire. Like the
others, it was abandoned shortly after the empire’s fall and remained
unoccupied for several centuries. After the collapse of Atacyl’s attempt
to regain control of Castle Blackmarsh, one of his lieutenants, Sir
Autse Darkheart (Ftr12), now occupies the ruins. Sir Autse was
transformed into a wraith and was made Atacyl’s second in command. The
ruins are now crawling with skeletons, zombies, wights, and lesser
wraiths under Darkheart’s command.

**1002** **Wedmor**, Pop: 255, Man(Ostrobard); Align L; Ruler: Lord
Octa, Ftr5, L; Resource: Cattle.

Wedmor was settled by the Ostrobards several centuries ago and has
become a center for cattle herding. Every fall, the herds are rounded up
and most of the bulls and old are slaughtered. The meat is salted and
shipped down the Rednut River to Muncaester and distributed throughout
the Blackmarsh region. Lord Octa is looking for additional hands to aid
with the roundup and guard against raiders and monsters.

**1014** This large island, in the midst of the Black Marshes, is a
nesting ground for a herd of chimerae. (HD 9)

**1103** Sixteen centaurs (HD 4) are running down a herd of cattle they
are planning to rustle. A mile away two herders (Ftr1) are riding at
full gallop back to Wedmor (see 1002) for help.

**1107** This grotto is home to 86 merman (HD 1). They are ruled by King
Neptar (Ftr4). They are holding a funeral for Neptar’s son who was slain
by a water elemental. (see 0909)

**1112** On the sea bottom, are the sunken remains of the last treasure
ships to sail from Blackmarsh before the fall of the Bright Empire.
Gold, adamant, and sealed crates with viz lie in the hulls of a dozen
galleys and scattered across the seabed. Taking residence amid the
crumbling ships is a school of several dozen sharks (2 HD) along with a
giant sea serpent. (12 HD)

**1113** **Inuacus Keep;** Sir Causari, Ftr10, L; 50 men.

This keep is an outpost of Castle Blackmarsh and protects the
surrounding farms from monsters moving north from the Black Marshes, as
well as Atacyl loyalists located in Jorvik. Sir Causari is the leader of
a faction that wants to see the elves leave Castle Blackmarsh and
restore human rule.

**1213** Located on Witch Hill are the foundations of Ramat, an old
ruined Thothian monastery from the time of the Bright Empire. It was
home to a potent holy artifact known as the Spear of Ramat. All records
on the monastery were lost after the empire’s retreat. In the present,
the young daughter of Governor Causari of Inuacus Keep lost her favorite
pet dog while on a picnic near the ruins. The governor will gladly pay
an adventuring party to search the ruins for the dog. (see the Ruins of
Ramat, from Brave Halfling Publishing.)

**1214** This island is home to a coven of warlocks. This coven was
established a century ago after the fall of Castle Blackmarsh. A few
surviving magic-users fled here with Atacyl’s body and oversaw his
resurrection as a vampire. In the transformation process, Atacyl
slaughtered half of the coven before fleeing into the bogs. Since then
the coven has struggled to survive and only a few aging members remain.

**1217** In the foothills north of the last peaks of the Westwall is the
steading of 8 hill giants (HD 8). They enjoy raiding the farms around
Jorvik and Norbury Castle.

**1302** **Camden**, Pop: 214, Man(Ostrobard); Align L; Ruler: Lord
Varxis, Ftr8, L; Resource: Iron.

Several iron mines dot the hills to the west. Lord Varxis has his hands
full trying to keep enough forces in the field to protect the mines.

**1305** **Muncaester**, Pop: 895, Man(Ostrobard); Align L; Ruler: Duke
Caedwine, Ftr4, L; Resource: Market.

Muncaester is the largest settlement of the Ostrobards, and the seat of
their dukes. It is located on an island in the midst of a bay formed by
the confluence of the Rednut River and the River Eamont. A thriving
market in farm produce, furs, and exotic herbs attracts merchants from
all over the Grey Sea.

Duke Caedwin is known for his great girth and wild banquets. He has
agents throughout the town on the lookout for new arrivals to provide a
banquet with tales of their exploits. The duke will not take no for an
answer.

**1306** A small group of five islands stretches southwest from
Muncaester (see 1305). They are home to dozens of fishing clans
harvesting the bounty of the Grey Sea. Several of the fishermen are
members of smuggler clans that specialize in moving goods in and out of
Muncaester, evading the duke’s taxmen.

**1307** This forested island lies unspoiled in the middle of the
Smoking Bay. The sorcereress Naomi (Mu9) ensures that it stays that way.
She relies on several dryads (HD 2, charm) for aid. She was once the
lover of the Wizard of the Isle, (see 1309) but he spurned her several
centuries ago. Because of this any male interlopers will stay as the
guest of the dryads for a long, long time. Females will just experience
memory loss and put adrift to sea.

**1309** The larger island is all that remains of The Mountain That
Fell. It is incredibly rich in viz although the lack of any beach and
the steep slopes make it difficult to get around. Any who managed to
brave the island not only has to contend with the ire of the Wizard of
the Isle but the numerous flyers dwelling around the slopes. There have
been reports of gargoyles, wyverns, griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi,
chimerae, manticores, and even rocs nesting near the summit.

The smaller island off the southwest shore is home to the mysterious
Wizard of the Isle (Mu18). His presence goes back centuries and all
anybody knows of him is that he is the self-appointed guardian of what
remains of The Mountain That Fell.

Anybody surviving landfall and subsequent attacks by the local creatures
will be apprehended by the Wizard of the Isle, and warned not to return.
They will be escorted back to their ship by the wizard’s golden
mechanical servant Cee-Three. He will calmly explain that they need to
seek their viz elsewhere and that The Mountain That Fell is very
dangerous to meddle with.

**1316** **Jorvik**, Pop: 481, Man; Align N; Ruler: Lord Maracan, Ftr11,
C; Resource: Market.

Jorvik was once one of the small villages allied with Castle Blackmarsh
until a century ago. When Atacyl rule was overthrown, several of his
supporters fled to Jorvik and fortified the village. They attempted
several plots to retake Castle Blackmarsh, but failed. Their aid of
Atacyl’s last failed attempt (see 0712) nearly ruined them and they were
forced to pay tribute to Castle Blackmarsh.

Lord Maracan is the current leader and his plans revolve around posing
as experts on the region to newly arrived scouts of the Grand Kingdom.
He is also attempting to enflame resentment towards the elves and their
ranger lackeys.

**1406** Two Vasan longships drift in the current, resting after a
several days of hard sailing. Each ship has 75 warriors on board. Their
chief, Egil Longhair (Ftr 8), plans to raid at sunrise.

**1503** A flock of 9 hippogriffs (HD 3) landed on Egbert’s farm two
miles from the river. The locals have gathered to watch. Egbert weeps as
his pigs and chickens are devoured by the hippogriffs.

**1506** **Ethanfeld**, Pop: 145, Man (Ostrobard); Align L; Ruler: Lord
Ingwold, Ftr6, L; Resource: Fish.

This village gains much of its livelihood from fishing, but also enjoys
some trade outfitting adventurers heading east to the Dragonbone Peaks.
Lord Ingwold leads 20 men known as the Dragonbane Company. They keep the
valley up river clear of monsters.

**1515** A shrine to the sea god, Mannann, is maintained on the island
by Tavis (Clr 8). His holy duty is to aid any shipwreck survivors. He
has a small single mast sailing boat he uses to search the surrounding
waters.

**1518** **Norbury Castle;** Sir Dennis Langre, Ftr9, L; 120 men.

This is the northernmost outpost of the Vasa Province of the Grand
Kingdom. Completed only five years ago, it is hoped that the castle will
serve as a gateway for merchants and explorers from the Grand Kingdom
into Blackmarsh.

Sir Dennis Langre served on the frontier with Grand Kingdom’s rival the
Ochre Empire and in some of the New World colonies. While he appreciates
the aid that Lord Maracan of Jorvik has given in learning about
Blackmarsh, he is beginning to suspect an ulterior agenda.

**1602** **Wessex Keep;** Bedewald the Atheling, Ftr6, L; 50 men.

This is the easternmost outpost of the Ostrobards. It shields the farms
and villages to the west from the creatures who dwell in the Dragonbone
Peaks. Duke Caedwin eldest son, Bedewald, is in command. He is the
opposite of his libertine father in almost every way. He was given
Wessex Keep to so that the duke wouldn’t have to hear his nagging.

**1609** The land between the coast and the swamp is occupied by 325
Kobolds (HD ½) of the Shelleater Tribe. They are divided into six
feuding clans who continually fight among themselves. They will only
unite when outsiders invade. They use their superior knowledge of the
terrain to make life miserable for the invaders.

**1701** In a cave beneath a rocky outcropping, an eight-headed hydra (8
HD) has taken residence. Bedewald the Atheling (see 1602) has a patrol
periodically check to make sure it hasn’t moved farther south.

**1706** Four rocs (6 HD) from The Mountain That Fell (see 1309) have
landed and are feasting on the remains of a sub-adult red dragon (see
2105). Three hundred yards to the east is the charred remains of a fifth
Roc.

**1709** On this island, in the midst of the swamp, there is strange
black monolith on top of a rocky outcropping. Every full moon weretigers
emerge from the surrounding bogs to perform strange rites. If the ritual
is watched for any length the players will discovered all races are
among the weretigers; elves, men, halflings, and dwarves. And even orcs,
goblins, and kobolds! Those who visited The Mountain That Fell (see
1309) will see that the monolith is made of the same type of stone.

**1807** In the middle of this forest is a confusing network of ravines
and hills. This is the current base of the Brotherhood of the Raven.
They are a group who believe in the supremacy of the elves. They have
operated against the rangers and other races of Blackmarsh for nearly
two thousand years.

Currently there are 158 Elves in residence along with 200 slaves, mostly
orcs. They are nominally led by the Autarch Elana (Ftr4/Mu8) who has
minimal authority over the various commanders and their troops. To get
anything done Elana has to continually negotiate compromises between the
different factions.

**1816** At the bottom of the lagoon are the remains of a ship that was
sent by the Grand Kingdom’s rival, the Ochre Empire to scout Blackmarsh.
It contains several treasure chests of gold for bribery and valuable
supplies to outfit expeditions.

**1902** This was a settlement of the Ostrobards that was burned out
several decades ago by the dragon Scytheback (see 2105). It was the hub
for several abandoned silver mines nearby.

**1905** This is an encampment for 15 elves from the Brotherhood of the
Ravens. They are led by Rinisar Anothil (Ftr 2/Mu 2). They plan to rouse
the hydra (see 1701) and drive it to the southwest to ravage the lands
of the Ostrobards.

**1911** This network of caves is home to 105 orcs (1 HD) of the
Bateater Tribe. They pay an annual tribute to the Brotherhood of the
Raven (see 1807).

**1914** A sleeping dragon turtle (11 HD) has drifted into the Sheltered
Bay.

**2015** Ten Vasan Vikings (HD 1) stand guard over supplies for the
return voyage of Egil Longhair’s fleet (see 1406).

**2105** This is the lair of Scytheback, a very old red dragon (11 HD).
She participated in the fall of the Bright Empire over a thousand years
ago and hordes the treasures she looted here. She made an alliance with
the Brotherhood of the Raven (see 1807) and considers them useful pawns
in keeping unwanted visitors away from her lair.

Over the centuries, she has had a succession of mates to breed her
young. Her current mate is Dakack, an adult red dragon (10 HD), whom
with she mated with twenty years ago. They are currently raising three
young that are now sub-adults (10 HD). One of them is missing (see
1706).

**2109** **The Tribute Place**: Kinkaris, Ftr6, L, Orc; 20 orcs.

This crude heap of stones serves as a keep for Kinkaris (Ftr7, Orc, C)
and his guards (Ftr 3, Orc). He has been placed in charge of collecting
the annual tribute for the Brotherhood of the Raven from the Bateaters
(see 1911) and Bloodcrusher tribes (see 2207).

**2114** On this idyllic island five mermaids (HD 1, charm) frolic in
the streams, collecting seashells, and gently placing them in a crystal
clear pool of water in the center of the island. Then on the night of
the full moon they collect the ones that turn into viz (4d6) and journey
to the Azure Lord’s hall. (see 2416)

**2201** Within the ruined castle, made of black stone, are twisted
skeletal remains. It is obvious that they came to some horrific end.
Several attempts over the last several centuries have been made to
reoccupy the castle. Nevertheless, after the full moon the new
inhabitants are slain in the same manner. The last attempt was made a
hundred years ago by the Brotherhood of the Raven.

**2203** In this corner of the forest, 85 pixies make their home. Their
miniature village is spread out among the trees built on small wooden
platforms. They gleefully torment anyone who intrudes.

**2207** This network of caves is the home of 243 Orcs of the
Bloodcrusher Tribe. They are ruled by King Suduk (Ftr 8) assisted by his
shaman G’mung (Mu6). King Suduk resents paying tribute to the
Brotherhood of the Raven and especially hates Kinkaris (see 2109).

**2306** The hills and ravines echo with the sound of battle as 15
berserkers (Ftr 1) from Castle Taldane battles 30 orcs (HD 1) from the
Bloodcrusher Tribe. The berserkers are surrounded on a ridge between two
ravines and are hard pressed by the orcs.

**2401** Along the side of a half-mile stretch of the river valley are
the warrens for 300 giant ants (2 HD). The queen’s chamber is built
around a long buried cubical artifact 10’ by 10’ by 10’. There is a door
on one side of the artifact, but the giant ants have not opened it. One
in twenty ant eggs can be used as a single viz.

**2410** Six 20’ tall black pillars with strange carvings can be seen
through the water on the top of a shallow bank. On further examination,
there are compartments on the ends of the pillars where viz can be
inserted.

**2411** **Ysby**, Pop: 80, Man (Vasan); Align N; Ruler: Chief Bjarni,
Ftr5, N; Resource: Fish.

This fishing village of Vasan Vikings was established two hundred years
ago by an improvised clan from Vasa. They kept contact with their
relatives, and when much of Vasa fell to the Grand Kingdom Ysby proved
to be an important way station for the refugees. Since the establishment
of Castle Taldane, it has returned to being a sleepy fishing hamlet.

**2416** A sea mount rises from the ocean floor to 15 feet beneath the
surface. Around the peak and down 80 feet are the grottos and caves of
the Azure King (Ftr12), a powerful merman lord. He rules over a tribe of
300 mermen. The Sapphire Enchantress (Mu12, Merman) is his advisor and
the current lover of the Wizard of the Isle.

**2505** **Castle Taldane**: King Ragnar the Ringless, Ftr9, N, Men
(Vasan); 200 men (Vasan).

King Ragnar’s grandfather was dispossessed by the conquest of Vasa by
the Grand Kingdom. He fled with what goods he could carry on his
longships and brought with him as many of his own and allied clans as he
could. In the decades since the petty kings of Taldane dreamt of
reconquering their home, but it has been a struggle to survive in
Blackmarsh let alone rebuild enough troops to mount a major military
expedition.

King Ragnar is known as the ringless after losing his royal signet ring
when his finger was cut off in a raid on Castle Blackmarsh. It brought
him great shame and now he spends his days in a drunken stupor beating
his dogs. Rumor has it that it is sitting in a jeweler’s shop in Castle
Blackmarsh.

**2509** **Gamla**, Pop: 405, Man (Vasan); Align N; Ruler: Chief Yngvar,
Ftr12, N; Resource: Farm.

Protected by the swamp to the west, Gamla has seen a small measure of
prosperity due to the fertile land. Chief Yngvar criticizes King Ragnar
(see 2505) at every turn. Yngvar is considering whether to challenge him
or whether to raise a rebellion to overthrow him.

**2618** A ship from the Ochre Empire is sailing toward Blackmarsh
searching for the lost expedition sent here five years ago. It is
commanded by Lord Travvarn (Ftr7, L), a powerful myrmidon in the Church
of Sarrath, the Dragon God. He is assisted by Archon Devers (Clr5, L)
who enforces a strict discipline among the ship’s crew and warriors.

**2704** **Daretop**, Pop: 415, Man (Vasan); Align N; Ruler: Chief
Kalfvald, Ftr8, N; Resource: Farm.

Daretop supplies much of the food for Castle Taldane. Chief Kalfvald is
an aging warrior past his prime. The chief is fiercely loyal to King
Ragnar and will come to his aid in any fight with Chief Yngvar (see
2509). However, his son Hamdir (Ftr7) does not share his father’s
loyalties. The death of Kalfvald will drastically alter the balance of
power for King Ragnar.

**2706** This island is crawling with giant crabs (3 HD). Longships from
Daretop (2704), Castle Taldane (2505), Gamla (2509), and Ysby(2411) come
here to hunt the crabs. It is dangerous, but great sport among the
vikings.

**2707** This island is deserted except for a single driftwood hut. Here
dwells Kostbera, a Vasan seeress. In exchange for food and supplies, she
will build a fire out of driftwood and seaweed to read the omens for the
giver.

**2714** Those who pass this spot report strange bubbles foaming the
surface. The few that have ventured down 100 feet have reported pieces
of a strange, giant, crystalline skeleton at the bottom. Even more
disturbing is that in the more recent reports, the skeleton is more
complete.

    must:

<!-- -->

1.  retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
    Licensed Material:

<!-- -->

1.  identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
    others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
    requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

2.  a copyright notice;

3.  a notice that refers to this Public License;

4.  a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

5.  a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
    practicable;

    indication of any previous modifications; and

3.  indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
    License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
    Public License.

<!-- -->

2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
    manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
    the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy
    the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that
    includes the required information.

3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4.  If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
    apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
    complying with this Public License.

**Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.**

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your use of the Licensed Material:

1.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
    the contents of the database;

2.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
    in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then
    the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not
    its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes
    of Section 3(b); and

3.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all
    or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

**Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.**

1.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
    extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
    as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
    concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
    statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
    non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
    discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

2.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
    You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
    or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
    consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs,
    expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of
    the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
    limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
    limitation may not apply to You.

3.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
    most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
    liability.

**Section 6 – Term and Termination.**

1.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
    terminate automatically.

2.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:

<!-- -->

1.  automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
    cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

3.  

> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
> right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
> this Public License.

3.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
    Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate
    this Public License.

4.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
    License.

**Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.**

1.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
    or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

**Section 8 – Interpretation.**

1.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
    not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
    on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made
    without permission under this Public License.

2.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
    conditions.

3.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
    Licensor.

4.  Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
    a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
    apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of
    any jurisdiction or authority.
